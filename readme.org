* Purpose

So this is a REALLY stupid singly linked list, the sole purpose of
which was to answer a colleague's question about implementing an
algorithm to reverse a sublist in-place, in one pass.

* Caveats

This is REALLY BAD CODE. For god's sake the list type is a struct. It
is all in one file. There is no makefile nor no configure file. It is
C-ish C++ (the latter used for =<iostream>=, universal brace
initialization, and nullptr, C++11 features of which I have become a
fan). There is no CLI; change the numbers and recompile old-school
style.

* Compiling

Given =g++-4.8=, compile like thus:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
g++-4.8 -Wall -std=gnu++11 main.cpp
#+END_SRC
